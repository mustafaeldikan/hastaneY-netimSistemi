I hope you fine 
To run my project you have to follwo these instructions :

1- you have to install Mariadb on your PC.

2- Start Mariadb and run the file "hospital.sql" as a query to create database
and the tables OR you can creat the database on your database management platform 
but in this way you must configure the connection URL in the project.

3- Start the file "Hospital_Management_System.jar" to run my project.
4-The login username and password for Admin Form is "admin", for Doctor Form
is "Ali" , "doctor" and for Receptionest Form is "Ali" , "RECEP" respectively.

I Hope it as you need.
